## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Overview

The product being which we will be developing is an Assignment Manageent System (AMS), which will manage the secure submission, management and distribution of assignment marks in a GDPR-compliant manner. Users in the system will have one of two roles, teacher or student. Ideally, user authentication will use the Universityâ€™s LDAP system.

**Through the system, students will be able to:**
* Securely upload assignments. Uploaded assignments will be timestamped.
* Depending on the setting of the assignment, a student may be allowed multiple uploads of an assignment.
* See a calendar of all upcoming assignments.
* Receive notifications of assignments, reminders of deadlines, and notification of results.
* Retrieve the results of all their assignments is a GDPR-compliant manner.

**Through the system, teachers will be able to:**
* Set the settings for their assignments. This will include, but not limited to:
    * due date
    * number of allowed uploads
    * notifications
    * marking scheme
* Upload assignments for students who signed up for their course.
* Mark assignments or upload marks from standard file types (.xls, .csv, etc.). This may include feedback to the student.
* Generate analytics of each module.

### 1.2 Scope
This system is being desigend for managing assignment. This system can also be used by any college/school as for managing their students assignments and teachers can gain analytics from the submission and the grade of the uploaded assignments. We are developing this system with the help all the free available tools relevent to the development of this system. 


### 1.3 Glossary

### 2.2 Interfaces

What a possible assignment submission page may look like



### 2.3 User Characteristics and Objectives

The product is a website and so can be accesed by anyone with a computer and internet access. However As it is a DCU assignment managment system, users will be verfied in some way shape or form so that only DCU Students and Teachers may login and use any of the features.

The Website will be highly accessible featuring an easy to use GUI to facilitate incoming first year computing or DCU students in general with little to no computing knowledge.


### 2.4 Operating Environment

* The development of this webapp will be done in Windows environment.
* The deployment of this webapp will be done on an Apache server in a Linux environment.
* The website will work on any opreating system that has an web browser which they can use to access our webapp.

### 2.5 Constraints

The contraints we face for this project are as detailed below:

- Database memory
Due to the limit of our SQL account there is a limit to the number of users we can service as there would be only so many asignments and submission that we could store.

- Time
This project is one in which we could continuously expand and add features and extra functionality to. We think the deadline will be just to demostrate the base required functionality.



## 3 Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Register

- Description:

This function is what registers users to the website. A Link will be provided on the home page tkaing a user to the DCU intranet where they will be able to enter their DCU credentials and register to use the website.

## 4. System Architecture
### 4.1 Backend
* We will be using .NET CORE  Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to implement our web app. This architectural pattern separates an application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller.
    * **Models:** Model objects are the parts of the application that implement the logic for the application s data domain. Often, model objects retrieve and store model state in a database. For example, a Product object might retrieve information from a database, operate on it, and then write updated information back to a Products table in SQL Server.
    * **Views:** Views are the components that display the application s user interface (UI). Typically, this UI is created from the model data. An example would be an edit view of a Products table that displays text boxes, drop-down lists, and check boxes based on the current state of a Products object.
ate of a Products object.
    * **Controllers:** Controllers are the components that handle user interaction, work with the model, and ultimately select a view to render that displays UI. In an MVC application, the view only displays information; the controller handles and responds to user input and interaction. For example, the controller handles query-string values, and passes these values to the model, which in turn queries the database by using the values.

### 4.2 Frontend
* With the help of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and jQuery. We will be building the UI of our system.
* UI will be user friendly and very minimalistic.
